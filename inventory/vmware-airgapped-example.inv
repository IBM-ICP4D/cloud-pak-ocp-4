# Indicate the method by which Red Hat CoreOS will be installed. This can be one of the following values:
# - pxe: CoreOS will be loaded on the bootstrap, masters and workers using PXE-boot. This is the default.
# - ova: Only for VMWare. CoreOS will be loaded using a VMWare template (imported OVA file).
# - ipi: Only for VMWare. CoreOS and OpenShift will be installed via Installer-provisioned infrastructure. OpenShift
#        will take care of creating the required VMs and automatically assigns hostnames. If you choose this installation
#        method, please also complete the IPI section in the inventory file.
#
# For pxe and ova installs you have the option of letting the prepare script create the VMs for you by setting
# vm_create_vms=True. This can only be done if you specify the vc_user and vc_password properties at the command line.
# If you specify run_install=True and vm_create_vms=True, the script will start the virtual machines. Otherwise, you must
# start the bootstrap, masters and workers yourself while the script is waiting for the bootstrap.
# When rhcos_installation_method=ipi, run_install is assumed to be True as well.

# Proxy settings. If the nodes can only reach the internet through a proxy, the proxy server must be configured

# the internal services domain (.svc) and the IP range of the cluster nodes (for example 192.168.1.0/24).
# Additionally, if the bastion (and other non-cluster nodes) have not yet 
# been configured with a global proxy environment variable, the preparation script can add this to the profile of all users.
